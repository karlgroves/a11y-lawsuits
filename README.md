This is the list of lawsuits I have on my website located at [List of Web-Accessibility related litigation and settlements](http://www.karlgroves.com/2011/11/15/list-of-web-accessibility-related-litigation-and-settlements/).

## Repository Contents

This data is as current and complete as I can make it as of the last commit date. Be aware that some links may be dead. For instance, the NFB changed something on their site in the last few years that broke a bunch of links. News sites frequently and inexplicably break links as well. Rest assured that at some point in time I've personally verified every single one of these lawsuits. For greater accuracy, there's always [Pacer](https://www.pacer.gov/), in cases where the lawsuits were filed in a federal court.

This data only focuses lawsuits surrounding the accessibility of website/ web-based systems and only where there was public information available. I cannot and will not disclose information that's not available to the public.
